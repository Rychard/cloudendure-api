 * Â© 2019 CloudEndure All rights reserved  # General Request authentication in CloudEndure's API is done using session cookies. A session cookie is returned upon successful execution of the \"login\" method. This value must then be provided within the request headers of all subsequent API requests.  ## Errors Some errors are not specifically written in every method since they may always return. Those are: 1) 401 (Unauthorized) - for unauthenticated requests. 2) 405 (Method Not Allowed) - for using a method that is not supported (POST instead of GET). 3) 403 (Forbidden) - request is authenticated, but the user is not allowed to access. 4) 422 (Unprocessable Entity) - for invalid input.  ## Formats All strings with date-time format are according to RFC3339.  All strings with \"duration\" format are according to ISO8601. For example, a full day duration can be specified with \"PNNNND\".
